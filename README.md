# RDF-RDFS-SPARQL



This is a uni project about RDF/RDFS and Sparql queries in order to have a first experience with that object.

A small description in english is that in the first two queries we have to create RDF triples of a given nature langueage sentence. In first query we have to do it without a blank node and with a blank node. In the second query we have to use the technique of reification. In the third query we have to create some classes,subclasses and properties and in the end create some instances for these classes. In the last query we have to create some SPARQL queries in order to extract some specific data from the RDF file we created in third query.
